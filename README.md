`IteratedProcessSimulations.jl` is a package which makes it easier to orchestrate generative statistical models (mockups of data generating processes) machine learning models and decision rules in an iterated framework so that the effects of digital learning systems can be more easily studied.

An example of how to use the package is provided in the following [vignette][vignette_reco].
